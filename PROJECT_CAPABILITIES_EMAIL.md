**Subject:** MassTransit Saga Framework Update - Lessons Learned & What's Working

**To:** Team Leadership

Hi everyone,

Wanted to share what we've learned building our MassTransit saga framework. It's been quite a journey with some interesting discoveries along the way.

**What we started with:** A simple Kafka demo that quickly became unwieldy when adding business logic.

**What we built:** A pattern that lets us add new business workflows without rewriting everything from scratch. The generic approach means when someone needs to add payment processing or inventory management, they're looking at maybe 30 minutes of work instead of starting over.

**Things that surprised us:**
• The reflection-based discovery actually works really well - no more copy/paste programming
• SQLite plays nicely with MassTransit sagas (took some tweaking on concurrency)
• Separating the mock APIs into their own service made testing much cleaner
• The retry logic handles restarts gracefully - we can literally kill the app mid-process

**Real examples working:**
Order workflow (create → process → ship) is running end-to-end with all the error handling and persistence. We also built a payment example to prove the pattern scales beyond just orders.

**What's honestly still rough:**
The onboarding docs are pretty dense (756 lines!), and there's definitely some over-engineering we could clean up. The reflection magic, while cool, might confuse new team members initially.

Would love to get your thoughts, especially on whether this approach feels right for our upcoming projects. Happy to walk through any of it in person.

Thanks for the feedback and guidance throughout this!
